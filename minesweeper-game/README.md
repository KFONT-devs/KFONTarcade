# Minesweeper Game

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. The player can reveal cells, and if they reveal a mine, they lose the game. If they reveal a cell with a number, it indicates how many mines are adjacent to that cell.

## Files
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the Minesweeper game, including the game title and game board.
- **style.css**: Defines the styles for the game, including layout, colors, and appearance of the game board and its elements.
- **script.js**: Implements the JavaScript functionality for the game, including initialization, user interactions, and game logic.

## How to Play
1. Click on a cell to reveal it. If it contains a mine, the game is over.
2. If a cell reveals a number, it indicates how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
3. Use the numbers to deduce where the mines are located and avoid them.
4. The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start playing the game.
3. Ensure that all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory for proper functionality.
